# FibRNG Peripheral - A pseudo random number generator using linear-feedback shift registers for TinyQV

[TinyQV](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/ttsky25a-tinyQV) is a Risc-V CPU designed for Tiny Tapeout. This repository hosts an entry to the [Tiny Tapeout Risc-V peripheral challenge](https://tinytapeout.com/competitions/risc-v-peripheral/).

The design has been developed in [Clash](https://clash-lang.org/). This repository contains a verilog file that was generated from the Clash source and tests written in cocotb/Python. The design will then be submitted to the TinyQV [repository](https://github.com/tinytapeout/ttsky25a-tinyqv). 

You can find in the repository hosting the Clash design [here](https://github.com/keszocze/fibRNG). 


## What it does: Generating (Pseudo-)Random Numbers

*FibRNG* is a reconfigurable (Pseudo) Random Number Generator (RNG) that generates random bits by via a Fibonacci Linear-Feebdack Shift Registers (LFSR) (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register) for a detailed description). For this, it stores two bit-vectors. The first one ($r$) stores the random bit string and the other one ($t$) stores the *taps*, i.e., the bit indices in $r$ that are using to compute the next bit. In each step, this new random bit $b$ is determined by computing 

$$b=\bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^{n} r_i \wedge t_i.$$

The vector $r$ is then updated by shifting in the new bit $b$ from the left, dropping the last bit to the right.

**Note:** The description of this document follows [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register). This means that the indicies into the bit-vector start with $1$ and increase from left to right, instead of starting from $0$ and increase to the left.

### Example
Figure 1 shows an Fibonaccy LFSR made from $16$ bits that uses the taps $1, 11, 13,14$ and $16$. The bit-vector $t=\langle 10000000 00101101\rangle$ is only shown implicitly as the numbers  above the bit-vector $r$.

The current vector $r$ is given by $r=\langle 10101100\, 11100001 \rangle$. The next bit is computed as $$b=r_1 \oplus r_{11} \oplus r_{13} \oplus r_{14} \oplus r_{16} = 1 \oplus 1 \oplus 0 \oplus 0 \oplus 1 = 0$$
and $r$ is then  updated to 

$$r=\langle 01010110\, 01110000 \rangle.$$ 

The update rule can also be written as 

$$r' = \left\langle \bigoplus_{i=1}^n r_i \wedge t_i\ ~~ r[1:31]\right\rangle.$$

The random number is obtained by reading the rightmost bit after each iteration.

### Maximum Length Sequences

Generating bit-vectors $r$ as described above is necessarily cyclic, i.e. after a certain number of iterations, $r$ will be in its initial configuration again. 

When using an LFSR one usually aims of obtaining sequences of maximal length (named *Maximum Length Sequences* (MLS), see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_length_sequence)) as this yields most random numbers given a specific configuration of the LFSR. 

There are lists of known taps that, for a bit-vector of length $n$ will yield a MLS of length $2^n-1$. The bit-vector $r=\langle 0 \ldots 0 \rangle$ must not occur as it will only ever generate a new random bit $b$ of value $0$, i.e., the number generation is stuck. Wikipedia has a list of taps for up to $n$ bits [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register#Example_polynomials_for_maximal_LFSRs9) and a [Xilinx Application Note](http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/application_notes/xapp052.pdf) provides taps for up to $168$ bits.


*FibRNG* is initially configured to produce a MLS for $32$ bits, i.e., the registers are set to

$$
\begin{aligned}
r &= \langle 11111111 ~~ 11111111 ~~ 11111111 ~~ 11111111\rangle ~ \text{and}\\
t &= \langle 11000000 ~~ 00000000 ~~ 00000100 ~~ 00000001\rangle.
\end{aligned}
$$


## How it is implemented

To match the interface of the [Tiny Tapout RISC-V Peripheral Competition](https://tinytapeout.com/competitions/risc-v-peripheral/), the Fibonacci LSFR is implemented as follows. The vectors $r$ and $t$ consist of $4$ words of $8$-bit length, i.e. are of total length of $32$:

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
r  &=\langle r_1\ldots  r_8 ~~~ r_9\ldots r_{16} ~~~ r_{17}\ldots r_{24} ~~~ r_{25}\ldots r_{32}\rangle \\
 &= \langle \texttt{FIBREG1} ~ \texttt{FIBREG2} ~ \texttt{FIBREG3} ~ \texttt{FIBREG4} \rangle
\end{aligned}
$$

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
t &=\langle t_1\ldots t_8 ~~~ t_9\ldots t_{16} ~~~ t_{17}\ldots t_{24} ~~~ t_{25}\ldots t_{32}\rangle \\
&= \langle \texttt{TAPS1} ~ \texttt{TAPS2} ~ \texttt{TAPS3} ~ \texttt{TAPS4} \rangle
\end{aligned}
$$

Reading the new random bit (i.e., $r_{32}$) is done as follows using cocotb (it should be straight-forward to translate this to a `C++` program):

```python
# Get the last (i.e., fourth) word
# (see the 'Register Map' section of the documentation for details)
fibReg4 = await tqv.read_reg(FIBREG4)

# AND'ing with the lowest bit to extract the new random bit r_32
# (the last bit in the last word)
randomBit = fibReg4 & 1
```

Furthermore, FibRNG can be in one of the following modes of operation: 

* `Stopped`
* `Running`
* `Explicit`

When `Stopped`, the RNG does not compute new random bits. Use this mode when configuring FibRNG (see the next section).

When `Running`, each clock cycle, a new random bit is computed and shifted into $r$. Note that clock cycles are not identical to read/write transactions. That means that having FibRNG in this mode does not allow to read consecutive random numbers.

When in `Explicit` mode, the next random bit $b$ (and, hence, $r'$) is only computed after having received the `Advance` command; see the configuration section below. Most likely, this is the mode you want to use when using FibRNG as a TTQV peripheral.



### Commands

FibRNG can execute the commands from the following table.  To execute them,  write the corresponding value to the `CMDREG` (`0b1111`) register.

| Command    | Value         | Description                                                          |
|------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Stop`     | `0b00000000`  | Set mode to `Stopped`; stops the random number generation            |
| `Run`      | `0b00000001`  | Set mode to `Running`; starts generating a new $r$ every clock cycle |
| `Explicit` | `0b00000010`  | Set mode to `Explicit`; generate a new $r$ on `Advance` command only |
|            |               |                                                                      |
| `Advance`  | `0b00000011`  | Compute the next random bit / $r$                                    |
| `NOP`      | others        | Does not do anything                                                 |

**Note:** The register addresses are shown in binary, *not*, hex!

### Configuration

To configure either the shift register $r$ or the taps $t$, set the operation mode to `Stopped` (or `Explicit` and then do not issue an `Advance` command while setting the new values) and then write to the registers corresponding to the individual words. Note that you *can* write to `FIBREG`$n$/`TAPS`$n$ in any mode but be aware that $r$ might be updated while your are writing the new values.


#### Example
As an example, we configure `FibgRNG` to be used as the RNG shown in Figure 1, i.e., $n=16$, $r=\langle 10101100 ~ 11100001 \rangle$ and $t=\langle 10000000 ~ 00101101\rangle$.

```python
await tqv.write_reg(CMD_REG, CMD_STOP)

await tqv.write_reg(FIBREG1, int('10101100',2))
await tqv.write_reg(FIBREG2, int('11100001',2))
# FibReg3 and FibReg4 do not need to be set to zero

await tqv.write_reg(TAPS1, int('10000000',2))
await tqv.write_reg(TAPS2, int('00101101',2))
# you *need* to clear the upper tap bits!
await tqv.write_reg(TAPS3, 0)
await tqv.write_reg(TAPS4, 0)

await tqv.write_reg(CMD_REG, CMD_EXPLICIT)
```

It is important to set `TAPS3` and `TAPS4` to $\langle 0000000\rangle$ as *FibRNG* will 
always compute $\bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^{32} r_i \wedge t_i$ (i.e., up to $32$ bits). The 
taps having an index greater than $n$ ($16$ in this example) need to be zeroed as otherwise
these upper bits are used in the computation of $b$. Entries $r_{i}$ with $i > n$ can have 
arbitrary values as they will not be taken into account as we have $r_i \wedge t_i = r_i \wedge 0 = 0$ for 
all $i > n$.

This example can be directly translated into a `C++` program.

### Register map


Reading from any address not specified in the table below will return the word `0b00000000`.

**Note:** The register addresses are shown in binary, *not*, hex!

**Note:** While the words start being counted by $1$, the concrete addresses sent to FibRng do start with $0$ internally.

| Address   | Name      | Access | Description                                       |
|-----------|-----------|:------:|---------------------------------------------------|
| `0b0000`  | `FIBREG1` | R/W    | $r[1:8]$, i.e., the first word of $r$             |
| `0b0001`  | `FIBREG2` | R/W    | $r[9:16]$, i.e., the second word of $r$           |
| `0b0010`  | `FIBREG3` | R/W    | $r[17:24]$, i.e., the third word of $r$           |
| `0b0011`  | `FIBREG4` | R/W    | $r[25:32]$, i.e., the fourth word of $r$          |
|           |           |        |                                                   |
| `0b0100`  | `TAPS1`   | R/W    | $t[1:8]$, i.e., the first word of $t$             |
| `0b0101`  | `TAPS2`   | R/W    | $t[9:16]$, i.e., the second word of $t$           |
| `0b0110`  | `TAPS3`   | R/W    | $t[17:24]$, i.e., the third word of $t$           |
| `0b0111`  | `TAPS4`   | R/W    | $t[25:32]$, i.e., the fourth word of $t$          |
|           |           |        |                                                   |
| `0b1111`  | `CMDREG`  | R/W    | Write: configure FibRNG                           |
|           |           |        | Read: read the current mode of operation          |

## How to test

The following cocotb code configures *FibRNG* to use a $3$-bit Fibonacci LFSR having the maximum length sequence of $2^3-1=7$. This is actual code as used in the `how_to_test_example` method in the [testbench](test/test.py).

```python
await tqv.write_reg(CMD_REG, CMD_STOP)

await tqv.write_reg(FIBREG1, int('11100000',2))
# FibReg2, FibReg3 and FibReg4 do not need to be set to zero
# but we do it "to be safe" anyways
await tqv.write_reg(FIBREG2, 0)
await tqv.write_reg(FIBREG3, 0)
await tqv.write_reg(FIBREG4, 0)

await tqv.write_reg(TAPS1, int('01100000',2)) 
# you *need* to clear the upper tap bits!
await tqv.write_reg(TAPS2, 0)
await tqv.write_reg(TAPS3, 0)
await tqv.write_reg(TAPS3, 0)

await tqv.write_reg(CMD_REG, MODE_EXPLICIT)


for i in range(8):
    # get current state of the RNG
    val = await tqv.read_reg(FIBREG1)

    # extract and print the upper bits
    v = f"{val:=08b}"[0:3]
    print(f"{i}: r=<{v}> b={v[-1]}")

    await tqv.write_reg(CMD_REG, CMD_ADVANCE)
```
